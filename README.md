# Getting Started

This project you can view on [https://ismelb.github.io/kinoman-react-app/](https://ismelb.github.io/kinoman-react-app/).

This is my first application that I developed from scratch by myself. It is somewhat similar to "[themoviedb.org](https://www.themoviedb.org/)," but with fewer options and a different design in some places. I used the MovieDB API for data requests and Firebase for the user database. I have implemented many features such as modals, search, sorting, pagination, tabs, routing, authorization, and more. Additionally, I have created a fully responsive version where all functions work.

All information about pages, movies, etc. is contained in the URL and transmitted through components, so you can copy any link and send it to another person, allowing them to view exactly what you sent. The application features authorization using Firebase, allowing users to create their own accounts and add any movie to their list. If a user forgets their password, they can reset it. All data is managed with Redux Toolkit.

As this was my first personal application, there may be some issues with the structure and development patterns.
